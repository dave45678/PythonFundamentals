    "Now that you are about to write longer, more complex pieces of Python, it is a good time to talk about coding style. \n",
    "Most languages can be written in different styles; some are more readable than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Python, PEP 8 has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style. Every Python developer should read it at some point; here are the most important points extracted for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.\n",
    "* 4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.\n",
    "* Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters so you can put multiple code files side-by-side on the display\n",
    "* Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.\n",
    "* When possible, put comments on a line of their own.\n",
    "* Use docstrings (longer comments) to explain functions and modules\n",
    "* Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4).\n",
    "* Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use CamelCase for classes and lower_case_with_underscores for functions and methods. "
